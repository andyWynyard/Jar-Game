# Jar-Game - Simple random number game, based on what is put into the game.

In the game you can choose what the jar is filled with and what the max values can be. It is then randomised to a number for you to guess. If you are above or below this number the game will tell you. There is also a feature to save high scores, but this does not persist. 

To run this game you will need an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. Simply copy the code into the IDE and run.
